    "about": "A common surgical procedure, hip replacements are often performed as a result of either rheumatoid arthritis or wear-and-tear caused predominantly by age.

A hip replacement can also be necessary in the event of a fractured hip, as the joint is fragile and once damaged it can be difficult for the joint to heal.\r\n"
